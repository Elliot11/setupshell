Setup shell
==========
This is going to be a shell script to help setup Ubuntu 12.04 LTS for working with Ruby on Rails. 

It will install curl, rvm, rubygems, ruby and rails. 

It will then setup some basic necessicities:
Nodejs for javascript
git for version control
chromium-browser for additional browser support

Sublime would be the prefered text editor.
